**Intro**

This project is designed to create an interactive social media website where users can add and like photos, and make minor adjustments to their profiles. The project implements concepts such as flexbox, grid, and applying fonts, as well as offering practice with handling text overflow, and media queries for displaying elements correctly over multiple screen sizes.
